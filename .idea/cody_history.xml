                      <text value="Explain what @components\modules\Contact\ContactForm.tsx:5-91 ( @components\modules\Contact\ContactForm.tsx ) does in simple terms. Assume the audience is a beginner programmer who has just learned the language features and basic syntax. Focus on explaining: 1) The purpose of the code 2) What input(s) it takes 3) What output(s) it produces 4) How it achieves its purpose through the logic and algorithm. 5) Any important logic flows or data transformations happening. Use simple language a beginner could understand. Include enough detail to give a full picture of what the code aims to accomplish without getting too technical. Format the explanation in coherent paragraphs, using proper punctuation and grammar. Write the explanation assuming no prior context about the code is known. Do not make assumptions about variables or functions not shown in the shared code. Start the answer with the name of the code that is being explained." />

                      <text value="The `ContactForm` component is a React functional component that renders a form for users to submit their name, email, subject, and message. The purpose of this code is to provide a user interface for collecting contact information and sending it to a server.&#10;&#10;The component takes no direct input, but it relies on user interaction with the form fields. When the user types into the input fields, the `changeHandler` function is called, which updates the `contact` state object with the new values entered by the user.&#10;&#10;When the user submits the form by clicking the &quot;Send Message&quot; button, the `onsubmit` function is triggered. This function first checks if all the required fields (name, email, subject, and message) have been filled out. If any of these fields are empty, an alert is shown to the user, prompting them to fill in all the fields.&#10;&#10;If all the required fields are filled, the `onsubmit` function sends a POST request to the server at `http://localhost:4000/messages` with the contact information in the request body. If the server responds with a status code of 201 (indicating successful creation), an alert is shown to the user confirming that the message was sent successfully. If the server responds with any other status code, an alert is shown indicating that something went wrong.&#10;&#10;After sending the message, the `contact` state object is reset to its initial state with empty strings for all fields, effectively clearing the form for the next submission.&#10;&#10;The component renders a form with input fields for name, email, subject, and a textarea for the message. The `TextField` and `Textarea` components are used to render these input fields. The form is styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes.&#10;&#10;When the user submits the form, the `handleSubmit` function from the `react-hook-form` library is called, which in turn calls the `onsubmit` function with the form event object as an argument.&#10;&#10;Overall, the code achieves its purpose by providing a user interface for collecting contact information, validating the input fields, sending the data to a server using a POST request, and providing feedback to the user based on the server's response. The logic flow involves updating the component's state as the user types into the input fields, validating the input fields upon form submission, sending the data to the server, and resetting the form after a successful submission." />

                      <text value="In WebStorm, you can search across all files in your project using the following methods:&#10;&#10;1. **Search Everywhere** (Double Shift)&#10;   - Press the `Double Shift` shortcut or go to `Edit &gt; Find &gt; Search Everywhere`.&#10;   - This opens a search bar at the top of the IDE where you can enter your search term.&#10;   - As you type, WebStorm will show you matching files, symbols, actions, and more.&#10;&#10;2. **Find in Path**&#10;   - Go to `Edit &gt; Find &gt; Find in Path` or press `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+F` (macOS).&#10;   - This opens the &quot;Find in Path&quot; dialog where you can specify the search term, file masks, directory scope, and various options like case sensitivity, regex, etc.&#10;   - Click &quot;Find&quot; to see the search results in a separate tool window.&#10;&#10;3. **Replace in Path**&#10;   - Go to `Edit &gt; Find &gt; Replace in Path` or press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (macOS).&#10;   - Similar to &quot;Find in Path,&quot; but this allows you to replace the search term with new text across multiple files.&#10;&#10;4. **Recent Find Usages**&#10;   - If you've recently searched for a symbol (e.g., a function or variable name), you can quickly find its usages across the project by right-clicking on the symbol and selecting `Find Usages` or pressing `Alt+F7`.&#10;&#10;5. **Structural Search and Replace**&#10;   - Go to `Edit &gt; Find &gt; Search Structurally` or press `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+F` (macOS).&#10;   - This allows you to search and replace based on code patterns and structures, rather than just plain text.&#10;&#10;6. **Search in Recent Files**&#10;   - Go to `Edit &gt; Find &gt; Search in Recent Files` or press `Ctrl+E` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+E` (macOS).&#10;   - This opens a popup where you can search within the recently opened files.&#10;&#10;These search capabilities in WebStorm make it easy to find and navigate through code across your entire project, saving you time and effort." />
